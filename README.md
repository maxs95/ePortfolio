Evidence is provided here of the following objectives:
1. Explain communication concepts and strategies
Communication is the process of sharing meaning. One strategy is HURIER method which means Hearing, Understanding, Recalling, interpreting, evaluating, and Response. to become an effective communicator using the HURIER method can improve communication and listening. Another communication channel is the non verbal kind such as body language, gestures can be used effectively to convey meaning as displayed by Angela Merkel 


2. Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations
Conducted a presentation/speech on the digital divide for indigenous people at uni. no recording available
can be updated after week 10.


3. Work effectively as part of a team
worked as a Hungry Jack's employee for 2 years, teamwork is critical for good drive-through times.
worked at 1800-Got-Junk for 3 years (2 man teams with up to 5 teams working per day) some duties involve communicating with other teams, managers, and business owners.
Worked as a corporate security guard for 5 years as a night security manager with up to 3 other security guards. duties involved patrols, reporting, updating regional managers, and liaising with VIPs.

4. Communicate effectively in a professional context
At my security job, there were several times that the building manager, regional manager of the security company, and finally the national manager
would be called to the building for meetings either about changes to policies or reporting incidents that happened.


5. Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.
Conflict management styles are often used, depending on the situation. Competing when used in the right context can lead to better performance at the risk of damaging
work relationships. Collaboration is when a group teams up to complete a task and can be successful so long as everyone is goal-driven and willing to work otherwise it can fall apart. Compromise is a solution where two parties agree to terms that they are either satisfied with or just have to accept to move on to the next step. avoidance is dodging responsibilities or conflict whether it would be a project or people. Finally accommodating is being agreeable or accepting the direction of a project just to keep the peace to achieve a goal.
